The Supreme Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna has very elaborately 
described the constitution of the soul in the previous chapter, 
with a view to deliver His intimate friend Arjuna from the ocean of 
material grief And the path of realization has been recommended:
buddhi-yoga, or Krsna consciousness.Sometimes Krsna consciousness
is misunderstood to be inertia, and one with such a misunderstanding often
withdraws to a secluded place to become fully Krsna conscious by 
chanting the holy name of Lord Krsna.But without being trained in
thephilosophy of Krsna consciousness, it is not advisable to
chant the holy name of Krsna in a secluded place where one may
acquire only cheap adoration from the innocent public.
Arjuna also thought of Krsna consciousness or buddhi-yoga, 
or intelligence in spiritual advancement of knowledge,
as something like retirement from active life and the practice of 
penance and austerity at a secluded place.
In other words, he wanted to skillfully avoid the fighting by using
Krsna consciousness as an excuse. But as a sincere student,
he placed the matter before his master and questioned Krsna 
as to his best course of action. In answer,Lord Krsna elaborately
explained karma-yoga, or work in Krsna consciousness, in this Third Chapter.
